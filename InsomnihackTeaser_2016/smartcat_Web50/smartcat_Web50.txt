Damn it, that stupid smart cat litter is broken again
Now only the debug interface is available here (http://smartcat.insomnihack.ch/cgi-bin/index.cgi) and this stupid thing only permits one ping to be sent!

I know my contract number is stored somewhere on that interface but I can't find it and this is the only available page! Please have a look and get this info for me !

FYI No need to bruteforce anything there. If you do you'll be banned permanently
